    <h2>To what extent has Covid-19 impacted the long term shopping habits of consumers in the UK?</h2>
    <br />
<h3>Motivation:</h3>
<br />
<p>This project aims to look at how the pandemic may have affected the long-term consumption patterns of consumers. In the years before the pandemic many feared the beginning of the death of the Highstreet. The pandemic resulted in a huge demand increase for online services which included a surge in online shopping. This posed the question of whether in-person stores would be able to survive in a post-pandemic world.
    <br />The graphs below help to explain the extent of the shift to online shopping and whether this has caused long-term effects on consumer habits.
    </p>
    <br />

<h3>Chart 1</h3>
<br />
<div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
<br /><br />
<p>Chart 1 is made with data from the ONS and outlines the motivation for the question. Online shopping increased greatly during the pandemic and has remained at a similar level since. While in-store spending naturally took a large hit but has returned to above pre-pandemic levels now.</p>
<br />

<h3>Charts 2 & 3</h3>
<br />
<img src="dendogram.png" width="450" height="300"/>
<br/>
<div class="chart3" id="Chart5"></div>
<br /><br />
<p>Charts 2 and 3 use yahoo finance data and compares whether online stocks are outperforming in person stocks.
     Chart 2 shows that apart from Alibaba and GAP the online and in-store stocks are clustered very closely. Chart 3 shows the Z scores of the stocks. In this data, we can see the recovery of many of the in-person stocks by 2023 and online stocks aren’t necessarily outperforming in-person.
    </p>
    <br />

<h3>Chart 4</h3>
<br />
<div class="chart2" id="Chart2"></div>
<br /><br />
<p>To look at the potential effects of the pandemic I collected data from PWC to look at the net changes in store openings and closures across the last 6 years. The data shows of there is a trend of negative net changes in all years. Since the pandemic the number of net changes has reduced implying that business is recovering and people continuing to shop in-store. </p>
<br />

<h3>Chart 5</h3>
<br />
<div class="chart3" id="Chart3"></div>
<br /><br />
<p>Again, to analyse in person shopping I used data from the Center for Cities to show the recovery of various high streets in the UK. The data shows while average footfall varies from its levels before pre-lockdown measures, all the cities apart from Aldershot, Spend Index is above 100, showing people's return to in-person shopping. The data also indicates that there is no clear correlation between store closures and the other two indexes.</p>
<br />

<h3>Chart 6</h3>
<br />
<div class="chart4" id="Chart4"></div>
<br /><br />
<p>To see whether there has been a sustained increase in online sales I used ONS data to show the breakdown of different sectors. As expected, all sectors online spending peaked at the beginning of the pandemic and while most remain above pre-pandemic levels a lot of the sectors proportion of sales has remained relatively constant. This implies that while the pandemic may have changed the habits of some consumers, many have reverted to how they consumed before the pandemic, opting to shop in-store again.</p>

<h3>Data:</h3>
<br />
<p>Chart 1 was created by using an API loop in <a href="https://github.com/joewilliams200217/joewilliams200217.github.io/blob/main/Chart1_loop.ipynb" id="link5">colab</a>. As the API created cannot be directly read by vega, I used the API all origins win key to debug the CORS problem. Also, as the dates created by ONS were not compatible with vega new date columns had to be created through transformations.
<br />Charts 2 and 3 were created using <a href="https://github.com/joewilliams200217/joewilliams200217.github.io/blob/main/ClusterDendogram.ipynb" id="link6">colab</a> using the clustering format that was introduced during tutorials. The yahoo finance data through colab with the data downlaoded and then added into vega for chart 3. 
<br />Chart 4 was created from a CSV accessed from the PWC and cleaned in excel as the original file presented the data in a very accessible way. 
<br />Chart 5 was created by downloading multiple CSVs and then cleaning each one and merging them within <a href="https://github.com/joewilliams200217/joewilliams200217.github.io/blob/main/HighstreetRecoveryMerge.do" id="link7">stata</a>. 
<br />Chart 6 was created by downloading data from the ONS which was inputted directly into vega. </p>

<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
<br />
<p>Overall, there does seem to have been a change in the habits of consumers, with the increase in online shopping playing a more prevalent role in their consumption habits. However, the recovery of in-store shopping has also been very positive across the last 3 years, with many places spending being back to pre-pandemic levels with some even being above. Hence, one would argue with the evidence above that long-term shopping habits have been changed to include a greater amount of online shopping, but not to as large of an extent as most feared. This question stimulates motivation for future studies as the data currently around this topic is limited. Hence with increased studies about the economy’s recovery from the pandemic in the future, there will be areas to extend this question.  </p>

<h3>Challenges:</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I aimed to run a regression in chart 5 however within Vega it only registered two points out of the 58 data points available. Hence, I opted for a scatter plot adding the shop vacant variable. </li>    
<li>The API all origins win went down for a short amount of time, so I created the graph with a CSV. Then it was brought online again however this highlighted the risk of using APIs. </li>
<li>I had problem with cleaning graph 3 within python so opted to clean in excel instead.<li/>
